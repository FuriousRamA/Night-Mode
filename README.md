# Night-Mode
To start using the night.js
add the night.js file to your website folder
copy this '<script src="night.js></script>' and paste it in your html file
add the nightStyle.css to your website folder
copy '<link href="nightStyle.css" rel="stylesheet">' in your html file
create a button and give it a onclick method andname it "night()"  
and thats it the body background will change into night mode with a transition of 0.5sec
  thanks😊👍
